SGNS2 is an open source stochastic chemical kinetics simulator written in C++. It uses and expands upon the Next Reaction Method to include dynamic compartments, multi-delayed reactions, and several stochastic molecule partitioning schemes which can be applied on a per-molecule-type basis when splitting compartments (e.g. when modeling cell division).
